# mario
A Java based game engine with the original mario as a demonstration game. 
I'd like to expand this engine from the tutorial serries by GamesWithGame
to create cross platform fighting games with rollback netcode.
Since this is a java based engine, platform portability may be difficult.
If you come accross this and have any suggestions, feel free to contact me
at any place listed on my github page. Thank you. :)
